# Quickstart: Run your dbt project with Dagster in 3 steps

---

## Step 1: Setup your environment

{% note %} **Note**: We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a Python virtualenv. Visit the [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more info. {% /note %}

Install dbt, Dagster, and the Dagster webserver/UI\*\*. Run the following to install everything using pip:

```shell
pip install dagster-dbt dagster-webserver
```

The `dagster-dbt` library installs both `dbt-core` and `dagster` as dependencies. Refer to the [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) and [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more info.

## Step 2: Create your code location file

Running your dbt project with Dagster can be easily done after creating a single file. For this example, let's consider a basic use case - say you want to represent your dbt models as Dagster assets and run them daily at midnight.

1. Create the Python file where you will add the Dagster code. Since this file will contain [all Dagster definitions required for your code location](concepts/code-locations), let's call it `definitions.py`.

   ```shell
   touch definitions.py
   ```

2. In this file, with your text editor of choice, add the following code. Make sure to update the `RELATIVE_PATH_TO_YOUR_DBT_PROJECT` constant so that it points to your dbt project.

   ```python startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart.py
   from pathlib import Path

   from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, Definitions
   from dagster_dbt import (
       DbtCliResource,
       DbtProject,
       build_schedule_from_dbt_selection,
       dbt_assets,
   )

   RELATIVE_PATH_TO_YOUR_DBT_PROJECT = "relative/path/to/your/dbt-project"


   my_project = DbtProject(
       project_dir=Path(__file__)
       .joinpath("..", RELATIVE_PATH_TO_YOUR_DBT_PROJECT)
       .resolve(),
   )


   @dbt_assets(manifest=my_project.manifest_path)
   def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
       yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()


   my_schedule = build_schedule_from_dbt_selection(
       [my_dbt_assets],
       job_name="materialize_dbt_models",
       cron_schedule="0 0 * * *",
       dbt_select="fqn:*",
   )


   defs = Definitions(
       assets=[my_dbt_assets],
       schedules=[my_schedule],
       resources={
           "dbt": DbtCliResource(project_dir=my_project),
       },
   )
   ```

---

## Step 3: Run your dbt project in Dagster's UI

Now that your file is created, you can run Dagster's UI to take a look at your dbt project.

1. To start Dagster's UI, run the following:

   ```shell
   dagster dev -f definitions.py
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

2. In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the asset graph for the job created by the schedule definition:

  <!--
  ![Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets](/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset-graph.png)
  -->

<Image
alt="Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets"
src="/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset-graph.png"
width={2688}
height={1680}
/>

3. In Dagster, running a dbt model corresponds to _materializing_ an asset. Because a schedule definition has been added to your code location, your assets will be materialized at the next cron tick. The assets can also be materialized manually by click the **Materialize all** button near the top right corner of the page. This will launch a run to materialize the assets.

## What's next?

Congratulations on successfully running your dbt project in Dagster!

In this example, we created a single file to handle a simple use case and run your dbt project. To learn more about our dbt integrations and how to handle more complex use cases, consider the following options:

- Begin the official dbt scaffold tutorial, like the [dbt & Dagster project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster).
- Checkout out the Dagster & dbt course in [Dagster University]("https://courses.dagster.io").
